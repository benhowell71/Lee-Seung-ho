# Lee-Seung-ho
Code used in article about Lee Seung-ho

Here is the code that I used to break down pitch-by-pitch data for an article about Kiwoom Heroes LHP, Lee Seung-ho. 
You can find the article here: http://benhowell71.com/lee-seung-ho-kiwoom-playoff-hopes/.
Using play-by-play data that I collected, I broke down and analyzed Lee's performances over the last 3 months and determined that his slider/changeup 
placement and usage were tied to his success in June/August.
